This is the first website that I ever made.
It is the product of just a week of learning.
The code is not well-structured and the classes and ID's can be quite confusing to understand on first look.
I keep this website as a reminder of where I started and where I am.
I didn't learn responsiveness that time so it's not suitable for mobile.
This website was a test of my basic skills as a beginner web developer.
It helped me to practice and understand the concepts of float, positioning, box-modal, margin, padding and colors.
I'm pushing this in the hope that It will help to clear some self-doubts of a person starting web development and make them believe in themselves.
If I can do it, so can you . So keep going.
